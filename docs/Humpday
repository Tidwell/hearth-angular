3 hrs / 4 top

6:00pm PST / 7:00pm Central / 8:00pm EST

signup opens 1hr before the start - must confirm present at start time or be dropped (do this via chat) - if we have more than 32, bring in someone that wants in (from waitlist), otherwise there will just have to be byes

managrind structure - you play what you bring, top 8 MUST submit a decklist (screenshot is fine), no modification at any time (at least for the first tournament)

payout via paypal

request screenshots of games just in case - if there is a conflict, we go with whoever has screenshots

admins can play, I won't just to ensure at least 1 totally impartial judge (plus i have a feeling we will have to resolve some issues mid-tourney anyway)

press release to be created with the info
logo and banner to be created

wrap up we will add a tab to the browse page, but cross-post to other forums

I'm thinking monthly $100 invitational (info TBD) - but in general, top 8 from all Wednesday tourneys automatic entry, plus top 10/20 on the leaderboard - something to keep ppl invested.
